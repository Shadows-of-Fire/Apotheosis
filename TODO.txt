Gem Dust as a catalyst in brewing, increasing potion levels by +1 above normal.

Recipes for upgrading Rarity Materials into the next tier.

---Suggestions---

 Some sort of item to directly upgrade 1 enchantment by 1 level. 
 Maybe a sort of legendary tome that can be enchanted or combined with
 books in order to make a sort of "tier up" for a certain enchant. 
 Would be nice for maxing out items via slow and steady progress rather than chance.
 
 a "payload" enchantment for crossbows that increases the damage of firework rockets?
 
 
 some changes to lapis, because it piles up really fast and you never
 actually have to worry about running out of it (configurable "fuel"
 for ench table or something else optional to make the ench process in general more end-gamish) 
 or rare temporary buffs to new table stats
 
 trident had a damage increasing enchant. One that wasn't specific to certain mobs 
 
 Allow enchantment name color to be changed as part of enchantments.cfg
 
 Make the book be granted when a user first interacts with apoth content instead of on startup.
